I did use the tool to make a .obj into a header and load it in.  if you want to see it you can change "StoneHenge" the "wheel" and it will load in
I left it on the StoneHenge so you can see the 2 different color and direction lights better.
Additionally, It won't let me get rid of the exe in the next folder, but you want to run the one in the project folder with all the files.
